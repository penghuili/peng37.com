Encrypt37 protects your privacy, you don't need to trust no one.

For contents that we want to share, we can share them via youtube, X, medium, tiktok etc.

But for contents, like our diary, family photos, personal notes, they are private, then they should stay private, and they should be encrypted before leaving your laptop or phone.

Never use products that send the plain text and raw files to their server. There are a lot of people in the company who have access to the databases, no matter what they say in their privacy policy, **THEY HAVE ACCESS**, you have to trust them to not check your content.

And don't forget about data leaks.

But with encryption, you don't need to trust no one.

All contents are encrypted before sending to server, so even those who have access to databases, they can't decrypt your content, they see nothing.

That's what Encrypt37 does, and Encrypt37 open-sources its code.
